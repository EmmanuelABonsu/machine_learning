This project was a comparative study to identify the strengths and weaknesses of diffent machine learning models on randomly generated labeled data.

It involved implementing binary classifiers including Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and KNN 
For regression, the models used included a linear regressor, Support Vector Regressor, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree regressor
